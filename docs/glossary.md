# Glossary v0.1

This glossary defines core terms used in the project. Each entry has a canonical name (English), optional Russian equivalent, and a short definition.  
Use these terms consistently across code, design, and documentation.

## Cosmology

### Inflation (Инфляция)
The expansion of the universe shortly after the Big Bang.

### Universe
it's a one run session of a game, it can be restarted as a New game, it contain information of how many Particles are made in this Universe, how many “Energy” earned by the Player, and properties of “Temperature”, “Time” passed from beginning of a Universe, and “Space” size of how much it resized from beginning of the Universe. 

### Energy
numeric representation of an earned by the Player in eV (electron volt)

## Matter & Structures

### Nucleus (Ядро)
The positively charged central part of an atom, composed of baryons.

### Atom (Атом)
A nucleus surrounded by electrons occupying orbitals.

### Molecule (Молекула)
Two or more atoms bonded through covalent or ionic bonds, involving electrons from different orbitals.

## Particles & Groups

### Particle (Частица)
General category including:
- Elementary: Quark, Electron, Neutrino  
- Composite: Meson, Baryon, Atom, Molecule  
- Force carriers: Gluon, W boson, Photon  

### Antiparticle (Античастица)
A particle with opposite electromagnetic charge relative to its counterpart.

### Lepton (Лептон)
Group of particles that includes the electron and electron neutrino.

### Boson (Бозон)
Force carriers. In this model: photon, gluon, W boson, Z boson.

### Quark (Кварк)
Elementary particle known in modern physics; building blocks of hadrons. Each quark carries a color charge property (red, green, or blue for matter quarks; cyan, magenta, or yellow for antimatter quarks) representing the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) force.

### QCD Color Charge
Property of quarks representing their interaction through the strong force. Matter quarks have three colors (red, green, blue) while antimatter quarks have their corresponding anticolors (cyan, magenta, yellow). This is not a real color but a quantum property visualized through colored gradients.

### Hadron (Адрон)
Composite particle made of quarks.

### Meson (Мезон)
Hadron composed of two quarks (a quark and an antiquark).

### Baryon (Барион)
Hadron composed of three quarks.

### Virtual Particle (Виртуальная частица)
Short-lived particle necessary for interactions between other particles.

### Quanta
Indivisible unit of energy or matter.

## Fields & Forces

### Field (Поле)
Represents the four fundamental interactions:
- Strong nuclear  
- Weak nuclear  
- Electromagnetic  
- Gravitational  

---

## Core Gameplay Terms

---

### Level (Уровень)
The zoom scale of the visible universe, ranging from microscopic to macroscopic.

### Epoch (Эпоха)
Represents time or a stage in the game’s progression.

### Singularity (Сингулярность)
An imaginary point with no size from which the universe originated.

---

## GUI elements Terms

### Playground (Игровая зона)
The main particle display area on screen, represented as a circle occupying the center of the viewport.

### Scale size
its a virtual zoom on how close we look into a stuff at Playground, 1x 10x 100x etc. it goes both ways from smallest things to biggest things, depends on the Player Phone, calculating diagonal inches and displaying length of a ruler compared to a static size of Particle circle shapes.

### Wallet
The amount of in-game currency **eV (electron volts)** available to the player, used to “create” new matter.
